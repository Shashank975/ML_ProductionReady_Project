# US Visa Classification Model

## Overview

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US allows foreign workers to enter the United States for temporary or permanent employment. This act also aims to protect US workers by setting requirements for hiring foreign workers to address workforce shortages. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) administers these immigration programs and manages job certification applications.

## Problem Statement

The OFLC processes a high volume of job certification applications from employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the US. To manage this influx efficiently, a machine learning model is needed to assist in the visa application review process. 

## Project Objectives

This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts whether a visa application will be approved or denied based on historical data. Key objectives include:

- **Visa Approval Prediction:** Assess whether a visa application will be approved or denied using the model.
- **Applicant Recommendations:** Provide recommendations on which applicants should be certified or denied based on specific criteria influencing the decision.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** FastAPI
- **Backend:** Core Python
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment:** AWS
- **MLOps:** Integrated for production readiness

## Features

- **Predictive Analytics:** The model predicts visa approval outcomes based on historical data.
- **Decision Support:** Recommends profiles for visa certification or denial to streamline the decision-making process.
